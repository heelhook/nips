NIP-102
=======

Event-specific zap markers
--------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:pablof7z`

NIP-57 specifies that zaps lnurls should be calculated using the lud06 or lud16 field of the profile of the author of an event.

This NIP defines the use of tags to event may specify an alternative destination for zaps.

When an event includes a `z` tag, clients SHOULD calculate the lnurl pay request based on it's value instead of the profile's field. An optional third argument on the tag specifies the type of value, either `lud06` or `lud16`.

```json
{
    "tags": [
        [ "z", "pablo@f7z.io", "lud16" ]
    ]
}
```
